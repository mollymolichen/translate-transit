# translate-transit

A website powered by Angular that allows people who speak two different languages to communicate about getting directions on Duke University's campus.

Navigate to translate-transit(master) > transit-angular project directory.

Run the app locally using "ng serve --watch â€“open". This opens the app on http://localhost:4200 by default.
If this fails, run "ng update @angular/cli" and try serving again.

Build the app using "ng build".

Deploy the app by navigating to translate-transit > dist > translate-angular and running "python-m SimpleHTTPServer". This opens the app on http://localhost:8000 by default.
